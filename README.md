# Pgrep

`Pgrep` is a `grep` rewrite, based off of the `minigrep` program found in the rust handbook. This was made solely to help me warm up after not writing any code for a month. Please excuse the rough code in this repository.

## Installation
```shell
git clone https://github.com/proudmuslim-dev/pgrep.git
cd pgrep
cargo install --path .
```
